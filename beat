      I'm beat!

And the rest is a matter of following the train of thought.

Riding on the cobblers at tremendous speed.

Just one thing after another. Another city.
 - another woman
 - another man
 - another drink
 - a new drink
 - another recipe
 - another beat

And the beat goes on. In this and this and this town. This and this and this woman.

There's a process to the game and the gist is to believe in the process.

And the process revolves around time. This you need to understand or Miles will leave you by the roadside in the grass. And you will wonder where time went. And you will have lost  it
